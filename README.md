### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 I'm a junior data analyst with a passion for turning complex information into actionable insights. I'm excited to be transitioning to a backend role, where I can use my analytical skills to help design and build efficient systems. In my free time, you can find me cuddled up with a good book or exploring the great outdoors. I'm open to any kind of collaboration.
